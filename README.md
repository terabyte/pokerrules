# Poker Rules

This document is the official list of rules for my home games. It is based upon [Dave's Home Poker Cash Game Rules](https://david.goodger.org/personal/poker/home-cash-game-rules.html).

# Overview

The goals of these rules are, in order of priority:
* Fun and fairness
* Simplicity and practicality
* Accuracy with Vegas casino rules

Mistakes happen! Any irregularity should be addressed with discussion and common sense in the spirit of fairness. The decisions of the floor manager (that's me!) are final.

If you are coming to my home game, you should expect to:
* Have fun! Poker is a game and win or lose, it should be fun
* Only play with money you can easily afford to lose
* Hold no grudges

## The Game: Texas No-Limit Hold'em

The game is Texas No-Limit Hold'em. Most games will be cash games, tournament variants will be described below.

### Getting Started

* For an overview of Texas Hold'em, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) or other resources
* We play no-limit, meaning you can go all-in at any time. If someone does not have enough money, they can still call and it creates a side pot. Having less money never forces you to lose the hand.
* We play with chips that are styled and colored to resemble casino chips. They are labeled $1, $5, $25, and $100. These chips will be assigned a value (usually 1/10th) so that a $30 buy-in gets you 300 chips, which is what you might normally sit down at a standard casino table with for a 1/3 game.
* You can top up to the table limit any time (between hands). You can leave the table any time but you cannot take some of your stack off the table, you have to leave the table for at least 2 orbits and come back to buy back in.
* The minimum buy-in is 30 BBs rounded up, and the maximum buy-in is 100 BBs. For a $0.10/$0.30 game this is $10/$30.
* There is a dealer button to show who is "the dealer" position - the actual person dealing the cards may be different. If you are new to poker, I won't make you shuffle and deal your first time unless you want to =)
* It is always ok to ask questions. Try to pay attention to the action.
* Do NOT discuss what cards you had during a hand, even if you are no longer in the hand, wait until the pot is awarded to someone. Any discussion can impact the result of the hand and is unfair to those still in the hand.
* Keep your highest value chips visible so people can estimate your stack. Try to keep your stacks "clean" (same color in a stack, not mixed)
* Keep your cards visible if you are in the hand, don't cover them with your hands or put them behind your chips. If you place a card protect or a $1 chip on them, it will be clear you are still in the hand.
* Place your bets neatly in front of you, do not push them to the middle. "No Splashing Ze Pot"!
* If the action is on you and you must call a bet and do not wish to do so, then you fold. When you fold, pass your cards face down towards the dealer, and the dealer will place them "in the muck". Once cards are in the muck, your hand is dead and you are no longer able to win the pot.
* Once everyone else has folded, you win the pot. The dealer will push the pot to you and you may elect to show your cards, or pass them to the dealer face down. Some players may elect to show one card, this is allowed.
* Once the betting has completed on the river and it is your turn to expose your hand, flip them over without waiting. The dealer will identify the hand verbally if it is the best hand. If another hand is shown which is better, the dealer will say something like "Flush beats straight" and put the losing hand into the muck. If you are certain your hand is beat and you were not called, you may fold your hand face down. Once all hands are in the muck except the winning hand, the dealer will award the pot and place the winning hand in the muck afterwards.

### Stakes / Chips

* Most low-stakes casino games are 1/2 or 1/3 with a $300 or $400 max buy-in. For this reason, we play 1/3 with a 300 chip buy-in, divided by ten, to yield a max buy-in of $30 but retain the "casino feel".
* New players should expect a few hours of play could involve losing multiple buy-ins. Don't play with more than you are comfortable losing. This also means luck and/or skill can result in winning a few buy-ins, which is a tidy sum!
* You can never lose more than you put on the table
* You can never be forced to put up more money because someone else has more money than you - what is on the table plays
* Just like a casino, chips are as good as cash on the table. If you need more chips, ask the banker (me) and I will sell you chips for cash. I keep all cash separately so at the end of the night people can sell their chips back for the same cash.
* There is no tipping, no rake, and nothing removes money from the game until people sell their chips back. I will always sell myself chips back last, so any mismatch is pretty much my problem, not yours.
* Chips should not leave the table or go in your pocket

### Betting Minutea

This stuff is just how it works in the casinos. You probably don't care about this but in case you are curious how it works, these are the rules I will enforce.

* Assuming 1/3 (small blinds 1 chip, big blinds 3 chips) - The first round, you can call the 3 chip blind or raise to 6 chips or more. On subsequent rounds, you can open for 3 chips or more up to every chip you have.
* If someone bets (or calls) 3 chips, the minimum raise is to 6 chips total. If someone opens for 10, the minimum raise is to 20. If someone calls 3 chips, and someone else raises to 10, the minimum re-raise is then to 17 (3 to 10 was 7, 17 is another 7 more).
* If someone bets 50, and the next player has 80 total and goes "all in", because 80 was not sufficient to be a min re-raise, it does not reopen the action. This means each remaining player that has not yet called 50 could choose to call 80 or re-raise higher, but the player that bet 50 may choose to call 80 but cannot re-raise higher than that.
* If someone bets 6 and you throw in a single chip without saying anything, even if it is a 100 chip, you are indicating a call. A single chip is always a call unless you say "raise". If you want it to be unambiguous, throw in a 100 and a 5 chip to make it a raise to 105.
* Verbal is *always* binding. If you say one thing, but put in too many or too few chips, the dealer will correct it by passing chips back to you or directing you to put more chips into the bet.
* When you bet, use a single forward motion. Do not place some chips out, then reach back and get more chips and put them out also. Do do the "movie thing" and say "I see your 100, and raise you 100 more!". This is called a "string bet" and it is not allowed because you might use your opponent's reaction to decide whether or not to raise or how big of a raise to make.
* No Angling: It goes without saying, but angles are NOT fun. Angles are using deceptive or non-standard actions to try to trick another player into making a mistake (like mucking the winning hand).

### Cards / Gameplay

* The dealer (usually me) should generally try to act like a vegas dealer - this includes keeping the deck in one hand at all times with a cut card covering the bottom of the deck until the final card is dealt, indicating who the action is on, etc.
* The dealer will offer a cut to the person to the dealer's right (the "cutoff")
* The dealer will always burn a card before dealing the flop, and again before the turn and the river.
* If a card is exposed, the dealer will show it to the table before mucking it. If it is exposed during the deal, the dealer will continue dealing the other cards where they would have gone, then will deal the card that would have burned to the person whose card was exposed, then place the exposed card on top of the deck as a "burn card".
* If more than 1 card is exposed during the deal, it is a misdeal and cards will be collected, shuffled, and redelt. The button will not move and blinds and straddles will remain in the pot.
* If you are "under the gun" (first to act, first player to the left of the big blind) and if you have not yet recieved any cards, you may post a "straddle". A straddle is a blind bet for 2x the current bet. This makes you like a third blind. You can then decide to check, raise, or fold if the action comes to you unopened. If you are UTG+1 and the UTG player straddles, you may straddle also. This continues all the way around the table.
* There are no button straddles allowed due to the complexity of figuring out the order of action.
* Once there is no longer any action (all players are all-in) players may request to "run it twice". All must agree, otherwise we'll run it once.
* If there are multiple all-in players, the dealer will create a side pot and figure out what goes into what pot. Let the dealer figure it out, it can be stressful so give 'em a break =)
* If a pot is chopped, and there is an odd number of chips, the extra chip goes to the first player on the dealer's left (i.e. first to act).
* If you bet or raised, and that raise was called, you must show your cards to win the pot
* If the final round checks around, first to act must show first
* That said, it is rude to "slow roll". Once the dealer says "show 'em", just flip both your cards over.
* You must show both cards to win a pot unless everyone else mucks.

## Variant: Tournament

Occasionally we will run tournaments. In these situations, the rules are slightly different than above:

* Each player that joins the tournament must stay to the end to win
* There will be a single buy-in (say, $30) and that will provide a set number of chips (example: starting stack 15,000, initial blinds 50/100)
* The blinds will gradually go up to force the action. Recommendations around blinds come from [Home Poker Tournament Blinds](https://www.homepokergames.com/home-poker-tournament-blinds.php)
* Once the tournament ends, we could do another one or return to cash game
* Depending on the number of players, a set number of places will pay out (say, 10 players means 3 places pay out).
* Example 10 person payout structure:
 * 10 people * $30 => $300
 * 1st place: 50% => $150
 * 2nd place: 30% => $90
 * 3rd place: 20% => $60
